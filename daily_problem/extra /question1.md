Write a function that, given:

1. an amount of money
2. an array of coin denominations

computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

Example: for amount=4 (4¢) and denominations=[1,2,3][1,2,3] (1¢, 2¢ and 3¢), your program would output 44—the number of ways to make 44¢ with those denominations:

- 1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
- 1¢, 1¢, 2¢
- 1¢, 3¢
- 2¢, 2¢

---

basically giving a number(K) and array of smaller int, find all possible combination to for K
