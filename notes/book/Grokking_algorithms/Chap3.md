## Chapter 3

You’ll learn about recursion, a handy technique used by many algorithms (such as quicksort, covered in chapter 4).

- You learn about recursion. Recursion is a coding technique used in many algorithms. It’s a building block for understanding later chapters in this book.
- You learn how to break a problem down into a base case and a recursive case. The divide-and- conquer strategy (chapter 4) uses this simple concept to solve hard problems.

This chapter deals with recursion. lots of diagrams here for visual representation. I would recoment this to someone who is learnning.
The algoritum went over this chaper is **stack** with push and pop.
